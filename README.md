# Assessing relationship between urban form and walkability in Kisumu, Kenya

In Kisumu, Kenya, a port city established in 1901, I'm utilizing scikit-learn for k-means clustering with Landsat 8 imagery to analyze urban landscapes. Additionally, I'm using OSMnx for street network analysis to gauge walkability, considering aspects such as street density and access to amenities, exploring the link between urban form and walkability.

Data sources include ESRI World Imagery Wayback satellite data, Google Earth Engine, OSM Street Maps data and USGS Earth Explorer.
